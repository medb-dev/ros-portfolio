    The Advancement in the Information technology sector is seen way too fast than ever before. And the Internet is one of the fundamental sources to discover any data instantly. Nowadays, having the website of your business is the priority on the internet, therefore a large number of new websites are dispatched every single day on the internet and this propensity doesn't appear to stop. Have you ever thought about how these websites are made? Designing & developing a website or application are the most important steps which are crucial. Moreover, there are a bunch of programming languages that are utilized for web development. 
    <br>
    PHP in web development is the most widely used programming language. It offers plenty of benefits like a scripting language, an open-source environment that runs on a web server, and is designed for making dynamic pages and applications.
    <br>
    <h5>

        Advantages of  Choosing PHP for Web Development
    </h5>
    
    As web development services options should be secured, fast, and reliable, it offers many more advantages to make it accessible to many people. PHP is a great choice and is dominating server-side web development with well over 80% of the market share. As per the report of W3Techs’ data, PHP is used by 78.9% of all websites as a known server-side programming language.
    <br>
    The PHP language is capable of minimizing code utilization, and it has its own memory development function. To collect the object codes from outside was not common before PHP-based web applications.
    <br>
    Below are some of the reasons that clearly explain why PHP development or programming language is the best choice for web development:
    <br>
    
    <h5>

        Open Source:
    </h5>
    
    <br>
    The first thing you need to know about PHP is that this technology is free from all licenses. The main part of it is the large community of developers who work with it. Programmers can learn it faster and can implement cutting-edge solutions as soon as possible. In fact, PHP has its own support, like many other programming languages. All these factors lead to the arrival of new frameworks, components, and other tools that make PHP even better. No wonder PHP is so widespread.
    <br>
    
    <h5>

        Scalability:
    </h5>
    
    <br>
    PHP is highly flexible. Doesn't matter whether it is an ongoing project or a previously completed project, editing the scripting language is very difficult & annoying for the developers, But in PHP there is an uncommon feature, By using this feature, you can modify the script at any point in time. So, the programmer doesn’t need to rewrite the whole code or command function again. Therefore, you can save time.
    <br>
    
    <h5>

        Security:
    </h5>
    
    <br>
    The PHP has separate built-in security features that protect the website from several security attacks. Though there prevails a wide-spread opinion of open-source is insecure, PHP refrains itself from those opinions. Moreover, PHP developers can also ignore common threats like data tampering, SQL injections, and more.
    <br>
    
    <h5>
        Performance: 
    </h5>
    
    <br>
    PHP executes its scripts much faster than other programming languages with several independent benchmarks that make it compete with its alternatives such as ASP.NET, JSP, PERL, etc. PHP 5.0 was fully revamped with a new upgraded memory manager to optimize its performance. In PHP, a third-party directory, Library, and APIs are also available to enhance additional performance and response time.
    <br>

    <h5>

        Frameworks:
    </h5>
    <br>
    The Frameworks are a collection of packages and products such as admin panels, CRMs, web sockets servers, profilers, payment integrations, queuing managers ETC. They create a certain ecosystem that allows PHP to do much faster and easier things. Interactive features, sophisticated design, and richer functionality are very required for the rapid progress of the web. You can go beyond Content Management Systems like WordPress, Joomla, etc, and do pretty much anything, combining a library of your choice with a framework that best suits the task.
    <br>
    Many new frameworks legitimize PHP to do bigger and greater things. Among them are Symfony, Laravel, Zend, Yii, Cake PHP, Code Igniter, and others. We use and like Laravel. It is our personal opinion and since we admire it much, we suggest our clients go with this framework.
    <br>
    Is PHP Still Relevant for Web Development in 2021?
    PHP for web development is very convenient, easy to learn, has many useful libraries, detailed documentation, it's Laravel framework has the best ORM (Object-relational Mapper) as compared to the other frameworks, task scheduling, Built-In Authentication, and Authorization, Templating engine, multiple file system makes Laravel PHP's best framework. And what is very important — it has a huge community. Some people might call this language an old one, but we consider it to be the best & classic.
    <br>
    
    <h5>

        Conclusion:
    </h5>
    <br>
    Now, you are currently mindful, there are numerous clarifications for why PHP is the most ideal decision for Web creation. Generally, the selection of the programming language depends upon the pros and cons of the options available. PHP is the language that can be used to build any kind of website/application in 2021, like landing pages and simple WordPress websites, ending with complex web applications/platforms like Facebook, Yahoo, Digg, Flickr, Wikipedia, etc.
